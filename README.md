DEKAL (C Version)

DEKAL is a strategic card game designed for 2–4 players that combines elements of trick-taking and hand management. Players compete to score points by winning specific combinations of cards and carefully planning their moves.

In our version coded in C, the deck and gameplay are fully implemented with random shuffling and simple AI for multiplayer mode.
How to Execute the Card Game
With Code::Blocks

    Download the project files and open the .cbp file using the Code::Blocks IDE (this IDE was mandatory as part of the assignment).

    Build and run the code within Code::Blocks.

Without Code::Blocks

    Download the project files.

    Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Clang).

    Open a terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the folder containing the source files.

    Compile the program manually, for example:

    gcc -o dekal main.c other_source_files.c

    Replace main.c and other_source_files.c with the actual filenames.



Project Structure

    main.c — Entry point of the program.

    Other .c and .h files — Contain the game logic, card handling, player interaction, and AI.

    .cbp file — Code::Blocks project file (optional outside Code::Blocks).

Notes

    The program runs in the console/terminal.

    This version is a digital adaptation; some aspects of the physical game might be simplified or altered.

    Random deck shuffling means the gameplay experience will differ each time.
